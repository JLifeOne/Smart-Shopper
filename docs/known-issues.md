# Known Development Warnings

## @babel/runtime helper export warning

While running the Expo development client you may see:

`
Attempted to import the module ".../@babel/runtime/helpers/callSuper"
which is not listed in the "exports" of "@babel/runtime" under the requested subpath "./helpers/callSuper".
`

This originates from upstream Expo/Metro packages and is safe to ignore for now. A follow-up issue has been filed so we can pick up the fix once it lands in the Expo toolchain.

## WatermelonDB JSI fallback

This warning appears when the app is running with remote debugging enabled.
Disable remote debugging or use the native Hermes runtime to take advantage of the JSI adapter.

## Vite "CJS Node API deprecated" log

Vitest prints:

`
The CJS build of Vite's Node API is deprecated. See https://vite.dev/guide/troubleshooting.html#vite-cjs-node-api-deprecated for more details.
`

This is informational for Vite 5.x. Track the linked issue and upgrade once Vite provides an ESM-only API.
